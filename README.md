# pydarts

Play with your friends and keep track of your darts scores!

## Features
- arbitrary start value (501, 301, whatever positive number you like, ...)
- unlimited number of players
- scores can be passed in sum (i.e. the total visit) or throw by throw
- finish suggestions
- player database to keep track of player performance (average, highscore, finishes, etc.)

## Upcoming

## TODO
- revisit finish options (e.g. 56, 46)

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/pylipp/pydarts
cd pydarts
mkvirtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3 pydarts
make install
make test
```

## Usage

For playing, simply type `pydarts` (with the virtualenv activated) and follow the instructions on screen. See `pydarts.session.Player._process_score` for more info.

### IMPORTANT

The last visit has to be entered throw by throw. Otherwise, the evaluation of the total number of throws per visit is not correct!

For displaying player statistics, type `pydarts --stats <player_name>`. You can put any number of names. Without any name, information of all players is printed.

Also, see the output of `pydarts --help`.

Have fun!
